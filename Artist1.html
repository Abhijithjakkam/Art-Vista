There are two versions of this painting, one housed at the Louvre Museum in Paris and the other at the National Gallery in London. The first version, created between 1483 and 1486, depicts the Virgin Mary, the infant Jesus, and the young John the Baptist in a rocky landscape. The painting showcases da Vinci's mastery of chiaroscuro and his meticulous attention to detail. The figures are beautifully rendered, with soft and delicate features, and the landscape is intricately layered with rocks, plants, and a mysterious grotto. "The Virgin of the Rocks" is a testament to da Vinci's artistic genius and his ability to capture a sense of spirituality and beauty in his works.</em>
